by the way you can have multiple masters
if master loses arbitration it lets go and goes into slave to see if its being addressed
(losing arbitration is determined by sampling the sda line i believe to see if its what you are sending)


cpu clock freq of slave must be at least 10 times higher than  the scl freqency
only master need set scl freqency= cpu clock freq/16+2TWBR*prescaler

NOTE TWBR SHOULD BE 10 OR HIGHER IF IN MASTER MODE

TWIE TO INTERRUPT ENABLE IN TWCR WITH GLOBAL INTERUPT ENABLE	in sreg

after interrupt twsr contains current state of twi bus
