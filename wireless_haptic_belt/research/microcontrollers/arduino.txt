Basic Arduino specifications
Microcontroller	ATmega168
Operating Voltage	5V
Input Voltage (recommended)	7-12V
Input Voltage (limits)	6-20V
Digital I/O Pins	14 (of which 6 provide PWM output)
Analog Input Pins	6 - can be used as digital making 19?
DC Current per I/O Pin	40 mA
DC Current for 3.3V Pin	50 mA
Flash Memory	16 KB (of which 2 KB used by bootloader)
SRAM	1 KB
EEPROM	512 bytes
Clock Speed	16 MHz

Also runs at 8Mhz at 3.3Volts in some configurations

good memory document at
http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/Memory

upgrade Atmega328 chips available for some board configurations, doubling sram and flash, should that be needed

It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, an on-board resonator

(most?)analog pins can be reassigned as digital IO pins

Consistent with our open source ethos

pre programmed bootloader and included oscillator/resonator-no need for other hardware,external programmers

are methods of bootloading wirelessly over both bluetooth and xbee

open source hardware, additions made to the platform, add on boards and such, can be given away and sold

open source support.  Lot of energy behind the project right now.  
many pre existing libraries
many forums

non proprietary, cross platform ide, in fact you can use eclipse as an ide or just text files and command line compiling in linux
Please see http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/DevelopmentTools for info on your platform.

Hardware Serial chip on board
pins 0 and 1 for rx/tx (also sent out via usb connection)

Hardware i2c on board
http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/I2C	
pins 4 and 5 for i2c

can do software serial on any 2 pins, not sure of performance
